Description: A simple user-friendly library based on the python module reservoirPy.
             It provides a flexible interface to implement efficient Reservoir
             Computing (RC) architectures with a particular focus on Echo State Networks
             (ESN). Some of its features are: offline and online training, parallel implementation, 
             sparse matrix computation, fast spectral initialization, advanced learning 
             rules (e.g. Intrinsic Plasticity) etc. It also makes possible to easily create 
             complex architectures with multiple reservoirs (e.g. deep reservoirs), readouts, 
             and complex feedback loops. Moreover, graphical tools are included to easily 
             explore hyperparameters. Finally, it includes several tutorials exploring
             time series forecasting, classification and hyperparameter tuning. This package was
             developed in the framework of the University of Bordeaux’s IdEx "Investments
             for the Future" program / RRI PHDS.
