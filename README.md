reservoiR is an R package designed to call the python module [reservoirpy](https://github.com/reservoirpy)
 through reticulate.
 
 The reservoirpy module implements reservoir computing, a machine learning method based on a set of randomly connected neurons where only the last layer is trained. This method allows fast training with good performance compared to usual neural networks.
 
 In order to install the package run the following :
 
 `devtools::install_github(repo = "reservoirpy/reservoirR")`
